            description: '<p>A Holocaust rescuer story that is not well known outside of Italy is of Gino Bartali, a champion cyclist in the 1930s and 1940s and winner of the 1938 and 1948 Tour de France, and the 1936, 1937, and 1946 Giro d’Italia. During the war, the fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, ruled Italy and believed that the Italians were a superior race, much as Hitler looked at his Aryan citizens. Together, they formed an Axis with the goal to take over the European and Mediterranean landscape.</p><p><img src="./images/MussoliniHitlerSM.jpg"></p><p>Bartali, however, held a different view. He grew up outside of Florence, Italy, with loving Catholic parents who instilled morals in the form of a strong humanitarian response.  Bartali’s father taught him to beware of ignorant fascists and that everyone should be treated as equals.  When the cyclist began winning major races including the Tour de France in the 1930s, he bucked the fascists by saying that he owed his athletic achievements only to God, not to them. </p><p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsD6v01f_Oo?start=8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Big races such as the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia were not held during the war. The French race organizers of the Tour protested the German-occupation of France, and no one would get behind Germany’s attempt to hold the race as a sign of national unity. Bartali was enlisted in the Italian army in 1940, but a medical condition prevented him from active duty and he was assigned as a courier and allowed to continue racing and training.</p>',

The antisemitic laws adopted by Italy in 1938 to limit Jews from jobs or owning businesses were rarely enforced. Foreign Jews fleeing the Nazis in their own countries found they could enter the Italian border without fear of deportation to Poland. They were more likely to be placed in internment camps run by an Italian aid society. The camps were more like small villages with relatively normal way of life, from synagogues to schools to market.</p><p>By September 1943, the Italian army was weakening and the Allies took control of southern Italy. An armistice was signed and Mussolini was removed from power. Hitler would not allow this critical part of Europe to fall so within days, the German army countered by fully occupying major Italian cities such as Rome, Florence, and Milan, as well as breaking Mussolini out of jail and bringing him to Berlin. The tolerance for Jews was now cast aside and the Nazi extermination policies were immediately enacted. Now there were ghetto round ups and trains packed with fearful Jews headed to Poland. The Jewish aid societies and their supporters went underground in desperate attempts to help the thousands of Jews that were hiding in Italy.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vZV7Pm4zrc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Once Germany began the occupation of Italy in September 1943, the terror that had been a reality for Jews in other countries finally came to native and foreign Jews as they were hunted by Nazis and fascists in the newly named Italian Social Republic north of the Allied line in Salerno. Networks such as DELASEM and the smaller religious networks that had already been helping them went into a world of secrecy and recruited others to help in their campaign to hide Jews or quickly send them to Allied or neutral territories. It was perilous work. German pilots dropped fliers from the sky that warned Italians they would be killed for hiding Jews (MIS). The Nazis showed no mercy even when they burst their way into the sanctuary of monasteries and convents looking for Jews. At an abbey in Certosa di Farneta, dozens of Nazis tricked their way beyond the doors into the peaceful courtyard. After searching the chapel and rooms, they tortured and killed 12 monks and 32 partisans and Jews.</p>',

The holy city of Assisi in Italy was considered a sanctuary city where fugitives of any kind could not be arrested. In all its history there was no record of a Jew living there, but in 1943 when they sought safety from the Nazis, the Bishop of Assisi, Giuseppe Nicolini, arranged shelter for them in 26 monasteries around the city.</p><p>One of Nicolini’s assistants in this effort was Father Rufino Niccacci of the San Damiano Monastery. Together, they organized the Franciscan monks, friars, and sisters to hide Jews safely, keep them fed, provide classrooms for the children, and also allow them to practice their faith. During their perilous six months in Assisi, no Jews were asked to adopt Catholicism during their stay and over 100 that were sheltered there lived.</p><p><img src="./images/BriziFalseIDPress.JPG"</p><p>Another crucial role of Assisi and its citizens was the creation and distribution of false identification documents from the Brizi family print shop for hundreds of Jews passing through the Assisi Network’s region. These were often picked up by Father Niccacci and handed off to Bartali under the cover of night so he could tuck them safely into his bicycle frame and carry them to their new owners.</p>',

            description: '<p>Another important contribution to rescuer research is Eva Fogelman’s coining of the term “rescuer self.” This described the psychological transformation rescuers underwent to rebalance the stressors of their new reality. They had to quickly manage and adapt to a world of deception, secrecy, and violence while caring for individuals who required food, shelter, and emotional energy. The rescuer self was a new identity built on strong moral foundations that allowed them to do what was necessary, to rationalize that their efforts were necessary and just. This identity was far more flexible than bystanders or those who did not pursue rescue at the same level. Their identities were solely about self-preservation of their status quo and an inability to adapt to new stresses from the war.</p><p>This rescuer self can be seen in the change of Gino Bartali’s identity as a cycling champion into his new, dangerous responsibility of meeting in secret with members of the Assisi Network and carrying documents for 1000s of kilometers through occupied Italy that would guarantee his arrest if not death. In addition to the constant threat of exposure, Bartali could not tell his wife, which constantly wore at him as he became conflicted with his moral obligation to his family versus that of saving Jewish strangers.</p><p><i>“The weight of it all nearly suffocated Gino. There was no question he wanted to help…but the danger involved was overwhelming. It ate at him…he grew even more restless and agitated, consumed by the fear of what might happen if he was caught…..He had two reasons more powerful than any other not to risk himself: Adriana (his wife) and son, Andrea. If he was caught helping Jews or even sheltering them, he could be imprisoned and killed by the German authorities, leaving his wife alone to fend for their two-year-old son. It was an impossible choice. The siren call of self-preservation was deafening, but a nobler impulse beckoned.” - Road to Valor</i></p>',

Bartali’s family in Florence had long been close friends with a Jewish family, the Goldenbergs. In the winter and spring of 1944 as the Italian fascists and German Nazis hunted for Jews, the Goldenbergs came to the Bartali family for help. He quickly found a solution to hide the family of four in a cramped, windowless apartment cellar in Florence. He never paused to think; he knew their lives were in immediate danger, and he found a solution despite the escalating danger to himself and his family. He also gave the Goldenberg mother false identification documents so she could leave the hiding space for food and water. They hid for almost nine months until Florence was liberated in August 1944. The young son, Giorgio Goldenberg, never spoke of how his childhood hero helped his family, but he became instrumental in testifying at Yad Vashem for Gino’s indoctrination into the Righteous Among the Nations.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/si6KHGJG_eM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>',
