            description: '<p>Tina Strobos (left) was a bright, 19-year-old medical student in Amsterdam when her country surrendered to the Germans in 1940. She had been brought up in a progressive, intellectual family that forged her moral values at a young age. They were self-described Socialist Democratic Atheists, which was a common freethinker movement at that time in Amsterdam. Her family and their social circle believed in science and reason, and rejected religious beliefs. They sought to rid themselves of the “tyranny of the clergy.” However, this never effected their morality. Rather, for generations her family held great values for life and had a tradition of helping others. </p><p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxEsjdgifEg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Holocaust rescuer researcher, Eva Fogelman, found that the most common motivation in rescuers was to be Moral, based on values developed from different sources.

Strobos’ upbringing among her parents and their progressive Amsterdam social circle instilled these ideals for justice.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ulDtwWQZKg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>',

            description: '<p>The entire eastern border of The Netherlands is shared with Germany. Hitler wanted to annex a population he considered their “Aryan brothers” and bring them back to their “kindred Germanic tribe.” The Dutch government tried to negotiate changing from a neutral country to an independent Nazi state, but Hitler wanted them under the Reich as quickly as possible. In May 1940, the small coastal country was invaded by the German military. The Dutch military’s aging artillery left it out-classed. On the fourth day, German bombs dropped on Rotterdam destroying the city and leaving 80,000 people homeless. The Dutch country surrendered and their leaders went into exile in London. </p><p>In other countries invaded by Germany, such as France and Denmark, a military-led government was set up with German military leaders. It was common knowledge that they did not always rule with such authority as Nazi Gestapo commanders in an installed civil government. Unfortunately, The Netherlands had this new civil government led by ruthless Nazi leaders devoted to Hitler and ready to implement his agenda. There was no hesitation enacting Hitler’s racial laws and there were ample Dutch civil servants and citizens willing to cooperate. </p><p>Strobos remembers that the Nazis at first tried to win her country’s trust, but they slowly began to reveal their ruthlessness. Jews were required to register and some were sent to forced labor camps or gathered into ghettos. By the fall of 1942 they were required to wear yellow “Jewish Stars” to segregate them from the non-Jewish Dutch citizens. There were curfews and raids and Jews were being shot in the streets. Nazis stood on rooftops surrounded by barbed wire and with machine guns pointed below looking for anyone to shoot. Strobos was left stunned by “the effort and time and manpower these Gestapos employed to catch Jews.” </p><p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/igFkssuWw7o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>',

However, there was a Dutch right-wing movement that began aligning with Hitlers racist agenda in the 1930s and resented the influx of Jewish refugees from other countries. When the Nazi occupation was in full swing, the Netherlands was full of collaborators. Special police units were formed by the Nazis to hunt for Jews, resistance workers, and rescuers, filling their days with terror. Jews tried to row to England or kill themselves. The person next door thought nothing of betraying his or her neighbors merely by noticing an increase in the amount of garbage being thrown out.</p><p>The Netherlands geography is mostly flat with vast open fields for agriculture.

When the deportations began in summer 1942, many Jews embarking for Westerbork believed they would be sent to a labor camp in Germany or Poland with their family, and that this was a better option than trying to hide and split up. Sadly, they did not know what lay before them. Strobos says that as connected as they were in the underground, no one knew how bad it was for the Dutch Jews once they left Westerbork.  They did not learn that these families were sent to the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Sobibor until after the war. By the summer of 1943, 107,000 Dutch Jews (75%) had been deported to extermination camps.  The 25,000 who stayed and hid in the Netherlands became the cause for the Dutch underground to protect.</p>',

Her home served as a place for planning meetings, for banned medical school classes, as a transit point for Jews on the run, and to hear radio broadcasts on illegal receivers. Each day brought new problems to solve, often with someone’s life at stake, including her own. It could involve hiding a Jew for a day or a week in their house, or riding her bike to pick up fake identification cards. This predisposition to action and ability to think on her feet while under the duress of war is a significant rescuer trait described by researchers Sam and Pearl Oliner. One of Strobos’ immediate instincts was to save Jewish children.

Strobos’ house was searched eight times and the Gestapo left nothing unturned, ripping up the carpets, knocking on walls, pulling pictures off the walls.</p><p>Rescuers who were well trained by the underground created escape routes from apartments to rooftops and nearby buildings. Carpenters with the underground used their talents to create creating hidden walls and spaces within shelves, under floors, and between attic rafters for Jews to hide when the Nazis came to raid. Strobos and her family would train the people they were hiding on how to hide quickly or how to escape their building into a nearby school.
